**Nuxt.js** is a free and [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software "Open source software") [web application framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework "Web framework") based on [Vue.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js "Vue.js"), [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js "Node.js"), [Webpack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webpack "Webpack") and [Babel.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel.js "Babel.js"). Nuxt is inspired by [Next.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next.js "Next.js"),[\[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuxt.js#cite_note-4) which is a framework of similar purpose, based on [React.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React.js "React.js").

The framework is advertised as a "meta-framework for universal applications". The term *universal* is used here with the meaning that the goal of the framework is to enable users to create [web views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface") in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") utilizing the Vue.js *single file component* system[\[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuxt.js#cite_note-5) and that can function both as in-browser [single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_page_application "Single page application") (SPA) views as well as server-rendered web views which are then (after server rendering) "[rehydrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydration_(web_development) "Hydration (web development)")" to full SPA functionality.[\[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuxt.js#cite_note-6)[\[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuxt.js#cite_note-7) Additionally, the framework enables users to have the content, or parts of it, fully pre-rendered on the server and served in the manner of [static site generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system#Static_site_generators "Web template system").

The benefits of this approach are, among others, reduced time to [interactivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactivity "Interactivity") and improved [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEO "SEO") compared to SPAs, due to the fact that full contents of each page are being served by the web server before any client-side JavaScript is executed. Put alternatively, one can maintain both the benefits of traditional server-side rendered HTML pages, and improved interactivity and advanced user interface of SPAs. The core benefit of the Nuxt.js framework itself is that it makes the configuration and setup of such applications simplified and seamless to the application developer, who can simply develop UI portions of the application as if it were a more common Vue.js single file application. NuxtJS version 3.0 has been announced by the developers.[\[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuxt.js#cite_note-8)
