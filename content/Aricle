# Welcome to our blog! 

In this blog, we will be talking about how developers code, what tools they use, and go a little further in depth on how those tools operate. 
There are many things developers and programmers use to create their code. Everything from basic coding applications such as VS code or Sublime, to complex frameworks and extensions. On this website specifically, we’ve used VS Code as our coding application, and the frameworks are Vue.JS and TailwindCSS. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a giant part of every web application out there. That is what makes things look fancy. Vue.JS is a frontend JavaScript framework created by Evan You. We won’t be talking too in depth about these topics as they are very vast and there are TONS of videos out there to learn from. 
Well, it’s easy to say they use a keyboard to type in inputs to the programming application but what makes it all work? That in itself is a complicated topic. There are many programming languages out there. Many are vastly different and some are similar, but no two are the exact same. Some are made for different things and some do the same thing differently. In web development we use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is the foundation on which everything is built. CSS is a part of a web developer’s soul, it is how you make everything visually stunning, catchy, easy to use, or in some cases, terrible. When using CSS you are trying to keep your audience or client in mind. You want the functionality to be good while keeping it easy on the eyes. JavaScript can be used for both frontend and backend applications. It is one of many programming languages out there. This is a whole beast in itself. JavaScript is what makes things happen behind the scenes. It is a very complex language and things such as case sensitivity and indentation will affect how and if your code will even run. Some examples are:
- Submitting information from a filled-out form
- Animations
- Calling information from other websites

What are frameworks?
Frameworks are platforms specifically for programming and these provide structure and built-in functionalities. By using a framework, you’re not starting entirely from scratch. They take into account the coding commands from the vanilla language (JavaScript) and make it easier to use. Don’t be fooled though, learning a new framework can be daunting and take time. After learning one, it will make you more efficient and more productive with your work, leading to more possibilities and less stress. Using a framework is heavily recommended in this industry and the experience is a must have if you plan on getting a job doing web development. If you’re interested in learning a framework, make sure to look into them, do some research for what their pros and cons are, and ask fellow developers for advice!
